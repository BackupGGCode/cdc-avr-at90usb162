== 1. Making a demo code run on AT90USB162 ==
Let's start our application with the demo code from LUFA Device/ClassDriver/VirtualSerial in `/ext/LUFA-111009/Demos/Device/ClassDriver/VirtualSerial`. This folder is copied into `/src` and since it's not coded for AT90USB162, we have to modify it to make it run.

=== Requirements ===
The high-level requirements for this application are:
  # Connecting the Minimus AVR on an USB port on Windows 7/64 it shall enable a COMPORT.
  # This COMPORT shall be available for connecting with a hyperterminal application (such as Microsoft Hyperterminal, Hypoterminal or other RS232-based app).
  # On the hyperterminal application, write 0/1 shall disable/enable a pin configured as output in the Minimus AVR.

=== Walkthrough ===
  # Code `/ext/LUFA-111009/Demos/Device/ClassDriver/VirtualSerial` imported from LUFA to `/src`.
  # Convert the code to AVR Studio 5.
  # Configure LUFA_PATH from `../../../..` to `../ext/LUFA-111009`.
